        textContent: "<div className={styles.para}>Trends in personal technology also doesn’t necessarily abide by the near-linear pace of technical development — instead, it can cycle more like fashion. Again, like in the fashion industry, there is a sense that previous generations did it better, removing such devices from the typically starry-eyed vision of technology’s ever-improving quality. The popularity of first the wired and subsequently the over-ear headphone is one example of this cycle in action.</div><div className={styles.para}>In 2021, after preferences had largely fallen in line with technical progress for years, wired headphones experienced a surge in popularity. This trend could be seen as a continuation of the broader Y2K movement, in which tech like tamagotchis and other gaming devices, digital cameras, and vintage headphones was a key component of the broader trend. The wired headphones were seen as an effortless indication of one’s distance from the digital world.</div><div className={styles.para}>The subsequent shift from the wired headphone to the over ear represents another frequent fashion cycle from minimalist to maximalist silhouettes. The release and popularity of the chunky, ostentatious Apple Airpod Maxes represent this transition at the corporate level, as the device has become both a status symbol due to its hefty price tag and a key component of ‘clean girl’ aesthetics that revolve around a sense of perfectly-manicured simplicity. The Maxes, like many of Apple’s products, serve as a blank canvas for customization through decorative charms, covers, and cases, but a parallel rise of the Koss Porta Pros suggests that the choice of the device itself without additional decorations is also a form of personal expression.</div> <div className={styles.para}>The popularity of the Porta Pros represented a continuation of the wired headphone trend, providing a high-quality listening experience characteristic of over ear headphones while maintaining the affordable accessibility and distinctly retro aesthetic of the wired headphones. Unlike the maxes, these devices are themselves a personalization – they don’t require any additional details other than their default 70s aesthetic to communicate their intended message. </div><div className={styles.para}>As accessories that interact with our physical bodies much as clothes do, headphones are one item of personal technology that acts more like an article of clothing than a piece of technology — the choice of the item itself communicates a message about its owner, following a model of pre-purchased uniqueness in contrast to other personalizations that require more modifications to the object itself.</div><div className={styles.para}>Like lovers of vinyl records or digital cameras, many over-ear headphone users accredit their choice to the devices’ superior functionality, which also brings the message communicated by the device one layer deeper. Alluding to a sense of functionality portrays oneself as rational and passionate, perhaps alluding to the devices’ owner’s superior expertise — itself an impression caused by the choice to adorn oneself with a specific set.</div>",

        textContent: "<div className={styles.para}>The smart phone revolutionized the shape of our telephones not only through its functionality but also its lack thereof – the perceived fragility of the early glass-encased smartphone models accelerated an existing trend to create protective cases that reduced damage on the increasingly expensive devices. </div><div className={styles.para}>Today, however, phone cases have become a key opportunity for personalization – one can choose their case based on color, texture, included accessories, and, of course, on its protective functionality. However, radical improvements in reinforced glass technology and an increasing availability of flimsy, obviously useless cases has led to the cases’ aesthetic role trumping its functionality. </div><div className={styles.para}>The constant prominence of the phone case may have been one contributing factor in this transition – while not everyone around you will have access to the phone’s digital content, the back of the phone faces away from the user and towards their surroundings, making it the most exterior-facing aspect of the device. As cell phones have gained a status as an extension of one’s personal space, the case becomes increasingly representative of its owner.</div><div className={styles.para}>In some ways, cell phone accessorization is not only no longer functional but also actively costs its user function at the behest of aesthetics. Sonny Angel dolls, for example, rose out of Japan’s Kawaii movement and today adorn everything from bedroom shelves to phone and laptop screens. The ‘hipper’ doll, which adheres to shelf-like objects, quickly became a popular collector’s item and frequently sits on top of one’s phone screen. As many Reddit users describe, adding a hipper to your phone makes it harder to fit in pockets, bags, and one’s own hands, but none suggest that this inconvenience was worth removing the doll. Instead, commenters suggested that ‘the cuteness is worth all the trouble whenever a waitress or barista gushes over it’ – highlighting the importance of such decoration for the direct purpose of communicating and connecting with others. </div><div className={styles.para}>Cell phones also communicate a message about their owner through a lack of personal adornment. A growing anti-case trend, for example, might suggest that the phone’s owner simply doesn’t care if their phone breaks as the cost to replace it is negligible. This trend is especially popular among those who express a goal to highlight the devices’ ‘beautiful hardware,’ perhaps serving to communicate a sort of technical expertise — itself related to the financial stability needed to risk such an expensive item — through their comfort with their bare phones. </div><div className={styles.para}>Cell phone manufacturers might have another reason to want customers to add the case – Valente, an IPhone owner interviewed by the BBC, suggested that going caseless ‘made me more conscious of the thing, and I find I don't get blindly sucked in as much as I used to. I can't believe I'm saying this but I think I'm actually using my phone less.’ Perhaps the appeal of the case, making the phone personalized to each owners’ precise needs – with stands, finger shelves, and grip texture – contributes to the ease with which the phone has come to act as an extension of our bodies.</div>",
