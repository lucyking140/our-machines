            "Trends in personal technology don't necessarily match the linear pace of technical development — instead, some devices follow a fashion-like cycle motivated by a reference for 'vintage' items. Like in the fashion industry, there is a sense of nostalgia for the supposedly superior products of previous generations, breaking from the typical perception of the technology industry's constant forward velocity. ",
            "In 2021, after preferences for personal listening devices had largely fallen in line with technical progress for years, <a href='https://www.teenvogue.com/story/wired-headphones-2021-it-accessory' target='_blank'>wired headphones</a> experienced a surge in popularity. This trend represented a continuation of the broader Y2K movement, in which tech like Tamagotchis, digital cameras, and vintage headphones reemerged. The wired headphones were seen as an effortless indication of one's distance from the digital world.",
            "The subsequent shift from the wired headphone to the over-ear headphone represents another frequent fashion cycle from minimalist to maximalist silhouettes. The release and popularity of the chunky, ostentatious Apple Airpod Maxes represents the manifestation of this transition at the manufacturing level, and the device has since become a key component of “clean girl” aesthetics that revolve around a sense of perfectly manicured simplicity (and prosperity, represented by the Maxes hefty price tag) that is opposite from the heavily-accessorized Y2K movement. The Maxes, like many of Apple's products, serve as a blank canvas for customization through decorative charms, covers, and cases, but a parallel rise of the Koss Porta Pros suggests that the choice of the device alone before decoration is itself a choice of personal expression. ",
            "The popularity of the Porta Pros represents a return to the pattern that birthed the wired headphone trend, providing a high-quality listening experience characteristic of over-ear headphones while maintaining the affordable accessibility and distinctly retro aesthetic of the wired headphones. Unlike the maxes, these devices and their characteristic 80s aesthetic are themselves a personalization – they don't require any additional decorations to communicate their owners' intended message. ",
            "Like lovers of vinyl records or digital cameras, many vintage headphone users accredit their choice to the devices' superior functionality, adding a meta layer underneath the message already communicated by the device. Emphasizing this sense of functionality portrays oneself as rational and passionate, perhaps alluding to the owner's superior expertise in, in the case of headphones, the music world. "

First translated to the digital world through features like Facebook's relationship status, symbols of our commitment to our significant other are a key step in the strictly-defined prescribed path to romantic success. In this dynamic, the public nature of the announcement is key -- illuminating a once-private relationship holds both members accountable to their new witnesses.",
            "Many Facebook users suggest that it was also this sense of publicness that prompted them to move away from the app's status update feature, causing the popularity of Facebook's relationship status to plummet in the <a href='https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/the-demise-of-making-it-facebook-official' target='_blank'>last 10 years</a>. Today, representing one's relationship through a lock screen builds on Facebook's digitization of the relationship status but softens its publicness, reducing the directness of the status update while still clearly indicating that the relationship is no longer secret. The lock screen, as the only part of the phone visible without authentication, is still inherently public but its visibility is almost entirely theoretical. ",
            "The use of the cell phone to record our most valued relationships also acknowledges that the phone has taken over the role of “default” personal object from something like the wallet. Storing an image in one's wallet was historically reserved only for those most important to its owner, with the wallet representing an object that is so necessary and often used that placing an image inside it indicates a desire to maintain constant proximity with its subject. Now, this same sentiment is ascribed to the cell phone — with the average person checking their phone <a href='https://explodingtopics.com/blog/smartphone-usage-stats' target='_blank'>58 times per day</a>, the lock screen has become one of our most frequently viewed mediums.  ",
            "Our choice of where to display relationship announcements also reflects their relationship to our self-identity — in a wallet, the images of one's loved ones sit directly next to one's official IDs, suggesting that those people contribute to one's identity as much as official status. Similarly, on Facebook, one's relationship status is displayed along with their profile, portraying a partner as an identifying trait just like a name or bio. Perhaps this pattern suggests that the cell phone has also increasingly come to represent our identities, as it is the primary device through which we message, post, and document our digital lives. "

Today, phone cases have also become a key opportunity for personalization – one can choose their case based on color, texture, included accessories, and, of course, on its protective functionality.

As <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/SonnyAngel/comments/16phufu/hippers_on_phones/' target='_blank'>many Reddit users</a> describe, adding a hipper to your phone makes it harder to fit in pockets, bags, and hands, but none suggest that this inconvenience was worth removing the doll.

This trend is especially popular among those who express a reverence for the devices' 'beautiful hardware,' perhaps serving to communicate a sort of technical expertise — itself related to the financial stability needed to risk such an expensive item — through their comfort with their bare phones. ",
            "Cell phone manufacturers might have another reason to want customers to add the case – Valente, an <a href='https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250410-why-your-phone-doesnt-need-a-case-anymore' target='_blank'>iPhone owner</a> interviewed by the BBC, suggested that going caseless 'made me more conscious of the thing, and I find I don't get blindly sucked in as much as I used to. I can't believe I'm saying this but I think I'm actually using my phone less.' Perhaps the appeal of the case, making the phone personalized to each owner's precise needs with stands, finger shelves, and grip texture, contributes to the ease with which the phone has come to act as an extension of our bodies."
